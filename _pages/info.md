Hi! 
I'm Kona. 
At the moment, this blog is just for me to talk about what my robotics team does, but in the future I hope to talk about many other things!
I am one of the 2 co-captains of FRC team SERT (South Eugene Robotics Team) 2521.
I've been a part of the team (mainly mechanical and software) since the summer of 2022 (my first season was 2023) and it's my main hobby (send help)!

I also do a lot of other things, such as UTAU/Vocaloid music/voicebank production (my website for that is [here](headhunter4621.github.io)), photography (mainly on film, but I also have a Canon EOS 40D), and other programming projects!

Continuing to work on prototypes

Tuesday, January 13 (4:00 PM - 7:00 PM)

At this meeting, the mechanical people working on the KitBot got the drivetrain fully (mostly?) assembled.
I helped cut and drill holes in the plates for the hopper (in the instructions they're made of polycarb, but we are making them out of some MDF thing that we originally used for practice game elements for BunnyBots.
We also made significant process on the indexer (?) mechanism. 
It hasn't been mounted to the drivetrain yet, but the belts and stuff work.

I am the person who volunteered ot program the KitBot in Kotlin (that's just the language we use), which is a pretty easy project, I just had to learn more about how Git works lol.

1 other mechanical member (a freshman who's *actually interested*, yay!) finished the tube prototype.
The mentor who got upset about the prototype being weird or something wasn't there today, so we finished what we had and it seems to work very well (exactly how I had expected)!

The CAD lead showed me the a Ri3D robot (Cranberry Alarm) and was talking about how it was a good design because it had an expanding hopper.
I didn't really understand until I watched a video of it in action, and now it's my personal favorite architecture.
It works so smoothly and I really like how consistent it seems.


Meetings until Scrimmage: `40`


## Things Completed at This Meeting:

### Mechanical:
- KitBot Drivetrain ~90% Done
- KitBot Intake/Shooter/Hopper ~60% Done
- Tube Prototype Finished
- Over-Bumper Intake was Assembled & Tested (works well)

### CAD:
- Designs for all prototypes were finished

### Media:
- Spirit Meeting (I did not attend (I was working on other things) so I don't know what was decided)

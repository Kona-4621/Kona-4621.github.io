Architecture/Strategy Discussion & Decision

Thursday, January 3 (4:00 PM - 7:00 PM)

Today, we had a very long discussion about the architecture and prototypes, which ended with us deciding on this architecture.

It has a wide fixed-hood shooter (which could be modified to be adjustable) and full-width tetra-style indexer, as well as a over-bumper intake. Through our prototyping, these seemed like all of the most reliable mechanisms. Though some mntors are upset about it, we decided not to do an above-level-1 climb, but this robot is able to have a level-1 only climb.

I voted for the expanding-hopper architecture, but I was really torn between that and this architecture, so I am completely happy with this decision :D


Meetings until Scrimmage: `31`


## Log update:

I have decided that rather than updating this daily, I will update it when either big things happen (like the architectre decision) or when I have noting better to do (I'm actually typing this on the 23rd).


## Things Completed at This Meeting:

### Mechanical:
- Cleaned Foundry before strategy meeting (while subteam leads were preparing for discussion)

### CAD/Strategy:
- decided robot architecture


## My Goals for Next Meeting:
- Update Scrum Board
- Talk to (interview?) some new members to see what leadership can do to make them more engaged and come more often

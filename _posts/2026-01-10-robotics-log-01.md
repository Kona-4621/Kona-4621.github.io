8:45 AM - 5:00 PM (I left at 4:30)

First day of kickoff meetings! 
We watched the livestream and made the MosCoW sort for robot actions and archetypes.
We also brainstormed "dream alliance" concepts for what we might see at worlds, that way we can think ahead and make predictions about how the game will go and design around that.
I think that the game this year will be incredibly fun compared to the other years that I have been doing FRC.
Charged Up was not too boring, but I didn't really know what was going on since it was my first year.
Crescendo ws a very exciting game, I liked how fast-paced it was.
REEFSCAPE was terrible. It was so slow and boring, and I felt like there was only ever 1 type of match strategy.
There was also only 1 general robot architecture, like there was some variation but not anything too major. 
I think this year will be much more exciting because it's kinda like 2022 (Rapid React), where you can make the game as complicated as you want.
For example, if you want to *just* make the kitbot, you can do that and honestly you won't do too poorly at week-1/2 competitions, but you won't get much further than that. 
BUT, if you design your own robot (ex. swerve and stuff, or maybe a turret), you can practice doing that and get much better throughout the season.

I'm excited to see how this game progresses throughout the season!
